# Miheson - My JSON (Linter)

Just a JSON Linter written in C. I wrote it using Emacs instead of Neovim just to see if I like Emacs.
Overtime I can see why some people love Emacs. Personally like Neovim/Vim Motion better.
After a week or 2 of trying emacs, I could not bare the pain of using modifier keys. My pinky hurts.
Don't get me wrong its not emacss' fault. It's my laptop keyboard. Perhaps I will try it again after
I bought a new keyboard
